If you've worked with **React.js** or **Next.js**, you've probably struggled with managing **Query Params**, and it always feels messy and unclear 😮‍💨

A few days ago, I discovered an open source library called **Nuqs**, and honestly—it made things a whole lot easier ✨

## Why not just use `useSearchParams` or `router.query`?

- Requires writing a lot of boilerplate to update query params
- No type safety
- Code becomes messy and unreadable
- Proper validation is hard
- And everything must be handled client-side

## So how does Nuqs solve all that? 💡

✅ Full **TypeScript** support with type safety  
✅ Works seamlessly with **SSR** and supports caching  
✅ Easily handles **multiple query parameters**  
✅ Clean and minimal code  
✅ Easy to implement **validation**

## Quick Example:

```tsx
const [search, setSearch] = useQueryState("q");
```

That’s it! You use `search` just like a normal `useState`, and any changes are automatically reflected in the URL 🔄

## Example with multiple query params:

```tsx
const [filters, setFilters] = useQueryStates({
  category: parseAsString.withDefault("all"),
  minPrice: parseAsInteger.withDefault(0),
  maxPrice: parseAsInteger.withDefault(1000),
  inStock: parseAsBoolean.withDefault(false),
});
```

## What are `parseAsString`, `parseAsInteger`, etc.?

Nuqs provides a set of built-in parsers like:

- `parseAsString`
- `parseAsInteger`
- `parseAsBoolean`
- `parseAsArrayOfStrings`
- And more...

These parsers:

🔹 Convert data from the URL (always strings) to proper types like numbers, booleans, arrays...  
🔹 Fully support **TypeScript**, so you get complete type safety and autocompletion  
🔹 Make your code cleaner, safer, and more maintainable  
🔹 And yes—you can also create your own custom parsers!

If you’re working with search, filters, pagination, or want to build **shareable frontend links**,  
I highly recommend trying **Nuqs** 👌  
You won’t regret it.
